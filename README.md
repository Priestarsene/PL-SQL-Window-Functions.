## ðŸ“Œ Problem Definition

Business Context:
A retail company operating in Rwanda wants to better understand customer purchasing behavior. The company sells a variety of products including beverages, bakery, dairy, and grocery items.
Data Challenge:
Management wants to identify top products per region, track monthly sales, measure growth, and segment customers for targeted marketing campaigns.
Expected Outcome:
Generate actionable insights such as top-performing products by region and quarter, customer spending segments, and sales trends using PL/SQL window functions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

The analysis will demonstrate the following goals using PL/SQL analytic functions:
1.	Top 5 products per region/quarter â†’ RANK()
2.	Running monthly sales totals â†’ SUM() OVER()
3.	Month-over-month growth â†’ LAG() / LEAD()
4.	Customer quartiles â†’ NTILE(4)
5.	3-month moving averages â†’ AVG() OVER()

## ðŸ›  Database Schema
Three relational tables were created:
â€¢	customers: stores customer details
â€¢	products: stores product catalog
â€¢	transactions: records all sales
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100),
    region VARCHAR2(50)
);
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100),
    category VARCHAR2(50)
);
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id NUMBER REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    product_id NUMBER REFERENCES products(product_id),
    sale_date DATE,
    amount NUMBER(12,2)
);
```

## ðŸ’» Window Function Queries
1. Top 5 Products per Region/Quarter â†’ RANK()
   
```sql
SELECT region, quarter, product_name, total_amount, rn
FROM (
    SELECT c.region,
           TO_CHAR(t.sale_date, 'YYYY-"Q"Q') AS quarter,
           p.name AS product_name,
           SUM(t.amount) AS total_amount,
           RANK() OVER (
               PARTITION BY c.region, TO_CHAR(t.sale_date, 'YYYY-"Q"Q')
               ORDER BY SUM(t.amount) DESC
           ) AS rn
    FROM transactions t
    JOIN customers c ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
    JOIN products p ON t.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY c.region, TO_CHAR(t.sale_date, 'YYYY-"Q"Q'), p.name
) ranked_sales
WHERE rn <= 5
ORDER BY region, quarter, rn;
```

2. Running Monthly Sales Totals â†’ SUM() OVER()

```sql
SELECT month, monthly_sales,
       SUM(monthly_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
FROM (
    SELECT TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
           SUM(amount) AS monthly_sales
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
)
ORDER BY month;
```
Insight: Shows cumulative sales growth month by month.

3. Month-over-Month Growth â†’ LAG()

```sql
SELECT month,
       monthly_sales,
       LAG(monthly_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS prev_month,
       ROUND(((monthly_sales - LAG(monthly_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month)) 
              / LAG(monthly_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month)) * 100, 2) AS growth_percent
FROM (
    SELECT TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
           SUM(amount) AS monthly_sales
    FROM transactions

       total_spent,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) AS spending_quartile
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
ORDER BY spending_quartile, total_spent DESC;
```

5. 3-Month Moving Average â†’ AVG() OVER()
```sql
SELECT month, monthly_sales,
       ROUND(AVG(monthly_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS three_month_avg
FROM (
    SELECT TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
           SUM(amount) AS monthly_sales
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
)
ORDER BY month;
```
Insight: Smooths out sales fluctuations by calculating rolling 3-month averages.
